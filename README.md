# Make a smart irrigation system for your plants using the ESP8266

This repository contains a PlatformIO project for making an ESP8266-based irrigation system for your plants.
This repository is still at an early development stage. More information is hopefully added soon!

## Wiring
Next to the ESP8266 a capacitive moisture sensor, an ultrasonic sensor, a relais and a pump are needed.
The moisture sensor needs to be connected to pin A0, the ultrasonic sensor to pins D7 (trigger) and D6 (echo) and the relais to pin D5.

## TODOs
A few features that can still be implemented are listed below.
- Log humidity/water level data
- Send the ESP to sleep after one loop to allow using it on battery
- At a factory reset function (using a button so that you can disconnect from a WiFi without being in that network)
